# Coding puzzle

We want you to program a command line based role playing game.

Here are the stories:
* As a player I want to create a character
* As a player I want to explore
* As a player I want to gain experience through fighting
* As a player I want to save and resume a game

These will be the technical constraints:
* Use Java
* Libraries and Frameworks are only allowed for testing and build pipelines
* Use best in industry agile engineering practices
* Please build for the command line

And here’s a little guidance:

* We wouldn’t ask you to fulfil this challenge if we haven’t had done it ourselves. 
The people looking at your code understand the problems we have been asking you to solve and most of us have been investing 3-­6 hours of effort. 
We generally would like you to use this as a guideline for your effort. 
But if you’re having fun and want to switch to beast mode, we can’t hold you, can we?

* If you need a topic: Choose something like Fantasy, Science Fiction, Cyberpunk, Fan fiction for a TV series or any random things. Surprise us!

* We’re not too bothered with the looks. Nevertheless, doesn’t everyone like some colors or ascii pictures when working on CLI?

* We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product. 
As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.

* Do you test drive your code? Are you aware of coverage?

* Does the code have instructions on how to run, build and extend it?

* We also consider the extensibility of the code produced. 
Well factored code should be relatively easily extended. As examples: Gaining experience has no effect in the current stories, 
but we bet it will have in the future. Will exploration be tracked on a map? 
Or maybe someone wants to switch the topic from Harry Potter to Lord of the Rings.

* This job is primarily Java, so submissions should be in that.

* Any indicator of design (DDD, or design patterns) would make us smile.

* Since the topic is pretty vast you are totally allowed to put your code to github to brag around with it.
